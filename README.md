## Task
This is the task given: 
``Implement the A5/1 algorithm. Suppose that, after a particular step, the values in the registers are
X = (x0, x1, . . . , x18) = (1010101010101010101)
Y = (y0, y1, . . . , y21) = (1100110011001100110011) 
Z = (z0, z1, . . . , z22) = (11100001111000011110000)

Generate and print the next 8 keystream bits. Print the contents of X, Y and Z after the 8 keystream bits have been generated.``

## Description
A5/1 is a stream cipher used to provide over-the-air communication privacy in the GSM cellular telephone standard. It is one of seven algorithms which were specified for GSM use.[1] It was initially kept secret, but became public knowledge through leaks and reverse engineering. A number of serious weaknesses in the cipher have been identified.

A5/1 is based around a combination of three linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) with irregular clocking. The three shift registers are specified as follows:

| LFSR | Lenght  | Feedback                                                            | Clocking | Tapped           |
| no.  | in bits | polynomial                                                          | bit      | bits             |     
|------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| 1    | 19      | x^{19}+x^{18}+x^{17}+x^{14}+1} x^{{19}}+x^{{18}}+x^{{17}}+x^{{14}}+1| 8        | 13, 16, 17, 18   |
| 2    | 22      | x^{22}+x^{21}+1} x^{{22}}+x^{{21}}+1                                | 10       | 20, 21           |
| 3    | 23      | x^{23}+x^{22}+x^{21}+x^{8}+1} x^{{23}}+x^{{22}}+x^{{21}}+x^{{8}}+1  | 10       | 10	7, 20, 21, 22|
